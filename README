A basic python stopwatch.Extremely unlikely to be accurate however when compared against my watch it seemed to be so.

Python graphics library/module can be downloaded from:
mcsp.wartburg.edu/zelle/python/graphics.py
The time module should be included.

Buttons explained:
Start - Starts the timer if stopped and unpauses it if paused. 
Pause - Will stop the timer incrementing.While paused only start and close buttons are responsive. 
Stop - Will Set the timer to 0,stop it incrementing and wait for start to be pressed again.
Reset - Simply sets the time to 0.
Close - Exits the program.
